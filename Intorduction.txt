 Redefining AI for the Real World

“Can I trust this business or person?”
“Please arrange my visitor access and parking.”
“Use my vouchers for quality dining.”
“Find me an agent to sell my property.”
“RSVP and secure my ticket to the event.”

These are practical, real-life requests that today’s mainstream AI systems simply cannot fulfill. Despite the hype surrounding generative AI and agentic models, the foundational question remains unanswered:

“Who are you, and can you be trusted?”

Introducing PrAIvacy: Trust Tech Architecture

While the world races to develop ever-more complex AI agents, the foundational layer—trust—remains neglected. PrAIvacy introduces the world’s first Trust Tech Architecture—a breakthrough infrastructure built to quantify trust as the core enabler of relationships and transactions.

Under five years, PrAIvacy has delivered eight comprehensive full-fledged enterprise-grade applications across proptech, fintech, legaltech, e-commerce, and enterprise sectors. Powered by AI, Big Data, and Blockchain, these platforms are designed around real user needs—not just tasks, but identity, credibility, and accountability.

The Problem We Solve

Most current AI systems focus on what you want to do and how to get it done. However, they fail to ask:

“Who is making the request?”

Our digital identities are fractured—managed by governments for regulation, financial institutions for compliance, but in daily life, reduced to emails and phone numbers. These low-barrier identifiers are the breeding grounds for scams, fraud, and distrust.

At PrAIvacy, we focus on “empowering the relevant stakeholders”, which forms the foundation of governance. However before public awareness on the critical importance of this matter, few users would voluntarily participate in this exercise, so we reverse this paradigm with a soft onboarding strategy: providing daily-utility applications that build verified identity and trust as users engage.
