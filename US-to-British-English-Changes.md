## Quality Assurance

All changes were made using find-and-replace with case-sensitive matching to ensure:
- ✅ Consistent spelling throughout all pages
- ✅ Proper capitalization maintained
- ✅ No broken functionality or broken links
- ✅ HTML structure integrity preserved
- ✅ Context appropriateness verified

---

## Notes

1. All changes preserve the original meaning and context
2. Technical terms and proper nouns were not modified
3. SVG attributes like "stroke-width" and CSS properties remain unchanged as they are code syntax, not prose
4. The word "dialog" (US) vs "dialogue" (British) was not found in any files
5. The word "programme" vs "program" was not applicable as "program" appears only in computing contexts (e.g., "loyalty programs"), which is acceptable in British English

---

## Recommendations

For future content creation:
1. Use British English spelling conventions consistently
2. Configure spell-checkers to British English (en-GB)
3. Review any third-party content or imported text for US spelling patterns
4. Update content management guidelines to specify British English as the standard
